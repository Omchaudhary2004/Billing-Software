# Billing Software

This project is a **Billing Software** built using **Django**, **Python**, and **SQLite** as the database. The application is designed to help manage the billing process, including item entry, sales, and other related operations. It uses Django's views and templates to handle frontend and backend interactions.

The project is still a **work in progress**. Currently, it includes basic features like a simple dashboard, item entry management, and integration between JavaScript and Django for button actions.

## Features
- **Dashboard**: Displays key statistics and information.
- **Item Entry**: Allows users to add, edit, and delete items in the inventory.
- **POS (Point of Sale)**: Feature to handle transactions (currently in development).
- **Database Integration**: Uses SQLite to store and manage item data.
- **JavaScript and Python Integration**: JavaScript frontend sends requests to Python backend to handle actions like button clicks.
